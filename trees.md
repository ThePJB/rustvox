# Trees

and for all placed structures, needs to be sorted out with a dependancy, and maybe some poisson disk sampling

how to get it out to the threads, pass in immutable reference
hope its not slow

maybe also MT the generation
not sure about the coordination, might be easier in a ST environment

and also like there will be a 2d / heightmap one

then structures

then trees

each can just be a hashmap I guess


in addition the base height map could be simulated rather than generated, e.g. erosion, CA, some voronoi stuff
