Tablelands, escarpments, Buttes, Hoodoos.

I've kinda got buttes from the remapping.

With noise theres always half and anti.
Dont want anti buttes though lol. Maybe you could use a neighbourhood sample. That might have some interesting effect, noise + neighbourhood sample.
Might be able to achieve tablelands with that


Tablelands need a certain shape. What if you have one thresholded noise map and another that checks and fills until its naked on 3 sides or something
want big regions with interesting edges. LF but domain warped maybe.


badlands too.

Vegetation and soil and stuff based on gradient.

river canyons.





Rivers would be great. Need a low res map. Could do voronoi for computing them and splines for integrating them. Splines could include river canyons.
what to do about the local minimas though? Maybe could plot local minimas and catchments, watersheds. Continents need to be shaped in a compatible way with reality.
water table and aquifers?
18% endorheic. Maybe could just make some big inland lakes. flood fill and if they go above some threshold they get outlets
also waterfalls.
Permeability / solubility of stone, matters for soil and erosion and stuff too.

glaciers and fjords would be awesome too, maybe in the same way as rivers. Whats with glaciers that are halfway down a fjord or whatever





Role of simulation? Seems like more emergence but more expensive and hectic. Could be fun to muck around with that idea from before with the CA.
Plate tectonics simulation, probably difficult but I wonder if any worthwhile simplifications of it exist







archaeological features. Especially really subtle ones with maybe some kind of magic significance


non monotonic remapping could totally be done, maybe for magic leylines or something

convolution technique is quite interesting
right now its very discrete and also linear

bigger simpler kernels could do something
if you want repitition tyhis achieves it especially for magic like hexagon shaped spawns etc

you could totally do filtering like this FIR as well or other techniques lol. gaussian blur.
